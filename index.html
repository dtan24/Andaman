      <h2> Andaman and Nicobar Islands</h2>
      <p class="andaman-description">The Andaman Islands are an Indian archipelago in the Bay of Bengal. These roughly 300 islands are known for their
         palm-lined, white-sand beaches, mangroves and tropical rainforests. Coral reefs supporting marine life such as sharks
         and rays make for popular diving and snorkeling sites. Indigenous Andaman Islanders inhabit the more remote islands, many
          of which are off limits to visitors.n 1789, the Bengal Presidency established a naval base and penal colony on Chatham Island in the
          southeast bay of Great Andaman. The settlement is now known as Port Blair
          (after the Bombay Marine lieutenant Archibald Blair who founded it).</p>

      <h2>Port-Blair</h2>
      <p class="port-description">Port Blair on South Andaman Island is the capital city of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands,
        an Indian territory in the Bay of Bengal. Its seafront Cellular Jail, completed in 1906, hints at
         its past as a British penal colony and is now a memorial to Indian independence activists. Inland,
          the Samudrika Marine Museum showcases local marine life.
        The Anthropological Museum focuses on the islands’ indigenous tribes.</p>

      <h2>Ross Island</h2>
      <p class="ross-description">Six decades later, the British had decided to establish a Penal Settlement in Andaman Islands and shifted the Penal Settlement from Singapore to Port Blair (Viper Island) in 1858. 1857 Revolt was a boon to the British for establishment of the Penal Settlement in Andaman Islands because establishment of a Penal Settlement in Andaman Islands was opposed in mainland of India and elsewhere. Capt. (Dr.) James Pattison Walker arrived in Port Blair on 6th March 1858 with 773 criminal convicts including 4 officials from Singapore. Capt.(Dr.) James Patterson Walker was the most trained jailor to deal with the hardened criminals. About 200 revolutionaries were deported to Andaman Islands; the ship with the revolutionaries sailed from Calcutta on 6th March and arrived in Port Blair on 10th March, 1858. Ross Island remained the Administrative Headquarters for the islands till 1945--`46. It was abandoned in 1945--`46 after reoccupation. Netaji stayed at the island during his visit to Port Blair from 29th to 31st December, 1943 during Japanese occupation. </p>
